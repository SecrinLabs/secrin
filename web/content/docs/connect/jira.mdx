# Jira Module - Coming Soon

The **Jira Module** is currently under development and will be available in a future update.

With this module, you will be able to:

- Connect your Jira account to Secrin
- Ingest project tickets and workflows
- Ask questions and get answers directly in your connected channels

We’re working hard to make this feature available soon.  
Stay tuned for updates!

> ⚡ Tip: In the meantime, you can continue using Secrin with **GitHub**, which is fully live.
