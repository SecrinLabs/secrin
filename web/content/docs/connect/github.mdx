# Connect GitHub

Secrin integrates with GitHub to bring your repositories, issues, and pull requests into your internal knowledge assistant.  
Connecting GitHub ensures Secrin can ingest project data and answer your questions with the most up-to-date context.

## How to Connect

Follow these steps to link your GitHub account:

1. Navigate to the **Connect Module** in Secrin.
2. Click **Add GitHub Account**.
3. You will be redirected to GitHub’s OAuth page.
4. Review the permissions requested like:
   - `repo` – access to private and public repositories.
   - `read:org` – access to organization membership and teams.
   - `webhook` – to get live updates of issue.
5. Click **Authorize Secrin**.
6. You will be redirected back to Secrin, and your GitHub account will appear in the **Connected Accounts** list.

> ✅ Tip: Only GitHub accounts you authorize will be able to provide project data. Make sure you authorize the correct account.

## Verifying the Connection

Once connected, Secrin will show a status indicator next to your GitHub account:

- **Green checkmark** – Connection successful
- **Pending** – OAuth process not completed
- **Error** – Connection failed; check troubleshooting below

You can also test ingestion by navigating to the **Source Module** and adding one of your repositories.
