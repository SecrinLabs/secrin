### Slack Integration

Coming soon — we're working on a smooth way to connect your Slack workspace with **Secrin**.  
Once released, you’ll be able to:

- Mention **@Secrin** in Slack channels or threads to get instant answers about your projects.
- Search project knowledge directly from conversations without switching apps.
- Keep your team aligned and reduce dependency on senior engineers.

Stay tuned — Slack integration is under development and will be available soon.
