## What is Secrin?

Secrin is your team's internal AI knowledge assistant.  
It connects with your work tools—like GitHub, Notion, Jira, and Slack—to help you instantly find answers about your projects without asking teammates.

Think of it as a unified memory for your team.  
Every decision, piece of code, and design note becomes discoverable through natural conversation.

## Why Secrin Exists

In fast-moving engineering teams, knowledge is scattered.  
Important context hides across repositories, tickets, and docs.  
New developers waste hours rediscovering what’s already known, and senior engineers are constantly interrupted with “quick questions.”

Secrin eliminates that dependency.  
By connecting your team’s tools, it builds an internal knowledge graph that can answer questions directly inside your workspace.

> No more “Where was that discussed?”  
> No more searching Slack threads or scrolling through README files.

## How It Works

Secrin follows a simple three-step model:

1. **Connect** your accounts (GitHub, Slack, Notion, etc.)
2. **Ingest** knowledge from connected sources
3. **Ask** questions in any channel — Secrin answers instantly with project-specific context
