## 🔍 What is Secrin?

Searching through code shouldn’t feel like archaeology.

Engineers lose hours every week answering the same questions:

* Who wrote this piece of code?
* Why was this logic changed?
* Where is the design doc for this feature?
* What issue or decision led to this refactor?

Secrin reduces that friction by building a **live knowledge graph** from your repos, commits, Jira issues, documentation.
Ask questions in natural language. Get answers with references instantly.

Think of it as **the memory layer for your engineering organization.**

## 🧠 Why it Matters

> Teams don't slow down because they forget how to code.
> They slow down because they forget *why* the code exists.

Knowledge lives everywhere:
repositories → issues → architecture docs → Slack → human heads

Secrin stitches them together into one searchable intelligence layer.
So your team can **search less and build more.**

## 🚀 How Secrin Works

1. Connect repositories and knowledge sources
2. Secrin parses commits, issues, and documents
3. Data is embedded, indexed, and linked via knowledge graph
4. Query from chat interface, GitHub comment, or Slack mention
5. Get direct answers with code lines, commits, authors, and reasons

No more digging through threads, files, PRs, or tribal memory.
