# üß† Secrin - AI-Powered Developer Context Engine

> **Intelligent codebase understanding through AI reasoning and knowledge graphs**

secrin transforms disconnected development tools (Git, Jira, Confluence) into a unified AI-powered context layer. Ask natural language questions about your codebase and get insights about *why* code was written, not just *what* changed.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **AI-Powered Q&A**: "Why did we switch to microservices?" ‚Üí Get context from commits, issues, and docs
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Connects Git, GitHub Issues, PRs etc
- **Knowledge Graphs**: Links related code changes, decisions, and documentation
- **Semantic Search**: Vector embeddings for intelligent code understanding

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

**Backend**: Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, ChromaDB  
**AI/ML**: Multi-provider LLM support (Ollama, Gemini), MxBai embeddings, Knowledge Graphs
**Infrastructure**: Docker

### üß† AI Models & Providers

secrin supports multiple AI providers through a factory pattern:

- **Ollama** (Local): DeepSeek-R1, Llama, CodeLlama, and other local models
- **Gemini** (Cloud): Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro and other Gemini models
- **Mixed Setup**: Use different providers for embeddings and text generation

Switch providers easily through configuration - no code changes required!

## üì¶ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SecrinLabs/secrin.git
