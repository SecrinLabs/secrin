## 🚀 Before You Start

* Check the [open issues](https://github.com/secrinlabs/devsecrin/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/secrinlabs/devsecrin/pulls) to avoid duplicating work.
* If you're picking up an issue, please make sure:

  * It’s labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or is clearly unassigned
  * No one else is already working on it (check comments or assignments)
* If no issue exists, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/secrinlabs/devsecrin/issues) with a clear description.

If anything is unclear, just ask in the issue or discussion thread — we’re here to help.

## 🙌 How to Start Working on an Issue

1. **Comment on the issue** to express your intent to work on it.
   *Example: `I'd love to work on this. Can you assign it to me?`*
2. Wait for confirmation or assignment from a maintainer.
3. Once assigned, go ahead and start!

## 👩‍💼 Development Workflow

The default working branch is `main`. All pull requests should be based on this branch.

### 1. Fork and Clone

Fork the repo to your GitHub account and clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsecrin.git
cd devsecrin
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Name your branch using the format:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/<area>-<issueId>-<short-description>
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/DSR-123-fix-readme-links
```
